	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	<h2>Data Protection at a Glance</h2>
	<p>
		We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and treat your data confidentially and in accordance
		with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
		The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you use our
		SimpleChat.
		Personal data is any data that can personally identify you.
		For detailed information on data protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below this text.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Data Collection on Our Website</h2>
	<h3>Data Controller</h3>
	<p>SimpleChat GmbH<br>
		Example Street 123<br>
		12345 Example City</p>
	
	<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
	<p>
		- IP address of the device<br>
		- Date and time of access<br>
		- Browser type and version<br>
		- Operating system used<br>
		- Pages visited on our website<br>
		- Referrer URL (the previously visited website)<br>
		- Hostname of the accessing device
	</p>
	
	<h3>Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
	<p>
		The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to deliver the website to the user's device.
		For this purpose, the user's IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session.
		The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website.
		In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology
		systems.
		An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
	<p>
		The data processing is based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our
		website and ensuring the security of our systems, in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Data Recipients</h3>
	<p>
		Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors and support us in the operation
		and maintenance of our website.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Storage Duration</h3>
	<p>
		The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
		In the case of collecting data for providing the website, this is the case when the respective session is ended.
		In the case of storing data in log files, this is the case after a maximum of seven days.
		Further storage is possible, in which case the IP addresses of users are anonymized, so that an assignment of
		the calling client is no longer possible.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Provision Required or Obligatory</h3>
	<p>
		The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.
		However, without the IP address, the functionality and security of our website cannot be guaranteed.
	</p>
	
	<h2>User Rights</h2>
	<p>
		As a user, you have the right to request free information about what personal data about you has been stored.
		You also have the right to request the correction of incorrect data and the restriction of processing or
		deletion of your personal data.
		If applicable, you can also assert your right to data portability.
		If you believe that your data has been processed unlawfully, you can submit a complaint to the responsible
		supervisory authority.
